Canny Edge Detection in OpenCV


void cv::Canny( InputArray 	image,
		OutputArray 	edges,
		double 	threshold1,
		double 	threshold2,
		int 	apertureSize = 3,
		bool 	L2gradient = false 
)

What are contours?
Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining 
all the continuous points (along the boundary), 
having same color or intensity. The contours are a 
useful tool for shape analysis and object detection and recognition.

#For better accuracy, use binary images. 
So before finding contours, apply threshold 
or canny edge detection.

#Since OpenCV 3.2, findContours() no longer 
modifies the source image.

#In OpenCV, finding contours is like finding 
white object from black background. So remember, 
object to be found should be white 
and background should be black.




How to draw the contours?
To draw the contours, cv.drawContours function is used. 
It can also be used to draw any shape provided 
you have its boundary points. Its first argument is source image, 
second argument is the contours which should be passed as a Python list
